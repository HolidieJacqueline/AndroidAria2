This is an unofficial Android port of powerful command line BitTorrent client aria2. aria2 is a lightweight download utility â€“ with footprint of ~9Mb and half as much of Java overhead, specific to this port. It supports everything, one expects from modern torrent downloader: selective file downloading, prioritizing chosen file segments (e.g. watching film while downloading it) and much more. See site of the desktop version for further details: http://aria2.sf.net

This application is NOT yet another Android remote control for desktop BitTorrent client! It embodies actual binaries of aria2, built for ARM and x86 with support for variety of Android versions, ICS and Marshmallow included (if you see this text, your device is most likely supported).

Note, that you DO need a frontend (e.g. remote control app) to download torrents with this port. All it does is launching aria2 binary with sensible parameters in user-friendly way; scheduling and controlling downloads have to be done by another app. For this you can choose between variety of third-party aria2 clients, developed by enthusiasts. I recommend Transdroid (free remote control app for large number of BitTorrent clients: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.transdroid.lite), but you can also try to use one of web clients (not tested by me yet, please write me if you are able to get any results with them):

This app does not prevent device from sleeping! During device sleep all downloads are greatly slowed and will most likely timeout. To prevent this for now you can use ATE integration and enable "Take WakeLock" and "Take WifiLock" in ATE menu when downloads are in process. Make sure to disable them afterwards, or you battery will discharge quickly. A better solution will be provided in future.

If you want to use one of advanced features of aria2, you can try to edit it's configuration file (named aria2.txt, stored in the same directory as downloaded files). Consult aria2 manual for additional details on the matter: http://aria2.sf.net/manual/en/html/index.html
