    'Persistent notification' is a technical term, used by Android developers

    used, among other things, to prevent Android background processes from being mercilessly
    restarted by system over and over, again and again (you can google for so-called
    'foreground Services'). That is: the use of a persistent notification by aria2 is required
    to made background downloading/seeding continuous without constantly yielding system resources
    to oh-so-important graphical foreground applications. For this reason it can not be unchecked
    at all. In fact it is there solely to let you know, that you *can not* disable that annoying
    notification.
